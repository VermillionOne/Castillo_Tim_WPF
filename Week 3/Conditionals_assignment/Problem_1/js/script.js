/*
We are going on a road trip and we need to decide how many vehicles to take.
We have four vehicles that we are able to use: Mitsubishi Outlander, Toyota Camry, Volkswagen Jetta, and Hyundai Entourage. Depending on the amount of people going, which vehicles will we need?
    The amount of people each car can carry is as follows:
        Hyundai Entourage: 7
        Volkswagen Jetta: 5
        Toyota Camry: 5
        Mitsubishi Outlander: 5
    We should also try to keep gas usage lower. In order to use the least amount of gasoline, we should use the cars with the highest Miles Per Gallon.
        Hyundai Entourage: 18
        Volkswagen Jetta: 25
        Toyota Camry: 23
        Mitsubishi Outlander: 20
